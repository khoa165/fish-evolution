# Fish Evolution game
#### Created by Khoa Thien Le (Harry) using Java + Processing graphic.

#### ***Usage***
- Since excutable jar file is not availble yet, game can only be run in Eclipse for now.
- From home screen, click "NEW PROFILE" and enter your name to start playing.
- Move your mouse to drag your main fish, the small orange fish, to eat the smallest fish (in blue).
- Notice your XP and your level on the navigation bar at the right corner.
- Once you level up, your fish would change appearance and you can start capturing the medium orange fish and then the shark.
- Don't panic when you see whales, they are friendly.
- Resume and restart features are currently being reviewed, so they are not working for now.

#### ***Bugs/features to be fixed***
- Re-organize the code and make it more structural.
- Add more levels and more fish.
